# Environment variables for Study-Pal
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to a new file named `.env` in the same directory (the project root).
# 2. Fill in the values below for each variable.
# 3. DO NOT commit your actual `.env` file to version control. Add `.env` to your .gitignore file.

# --- Google Drive Integration ---
# These variables are required for the Google Drive synchronization feature.
# They are used in `src/hooks/cloudStorage/getGoogleDrive.ts` to initialize the Google API client (`gapi`)
# and handle OAuth 2.0 authentication, allowing the app to store data in the user's Google Drive AppData folder.
#
# How to obtain these credentials:
# 1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
# 2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
# 3. Enable the "Google Drive API" for your project (APIs & Services -> Library).
# 4. Go to "APIs & Services" -> "Credentials".
# 5. Create Credentials -> "API key". Copy the key and paste it below for VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY.
#    - It's recommended to restrict the API key (e.g., HTTP referrers) for security.
# 6. Create Credentials -> "OAuth 2.0 Client ID".
#    - Select "Web application" as the application type.
#    - Add "Authorized JavaScript origins" (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` for local development, your production URL).
#    - Add "Authorized redirect URIs" (often the same as origins for client-side flows, check Google documentation if unsure).
#    - Copy the "Client ID" and paste it below for VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_cloud_api_key_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here

# --- Google Gemini Integration ---
# This variable is used for interacting with the Google Gemini API, primarily for AI-powered features like the Copilot.
# - It is used directly in integration tests (`src/tests/geminiService.*.test.ts`) to test against the real API.
# - It *can* be used by `src/services/GeminiService.ts` during initialization *if* `import.meta.env.MODE === 'test'`.
# - IMPORTANT: In normal application usage (non-test mode), the application uses the Gemini API key provided by the *user*
#   through the settings UI (`src/components/settings/Item_GeminiApiKey.tsx`), which is stored separately (likely via `settingsStore`).
#   Therefore, this `.env` variable is mainly for development and testing the integration.
#
# How to obtain this credential:
# 1. Go to Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# 2. Sign in with your Google account.
# 3. "Create API key in new project" or use an existing one.
# 4. Copy the generated API key and paste it below.
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
